# Practice Module

## Approach: Case-Driven Sentence Completion

Practice is structured around Czech grammatical cases, introduced one at a time in order of frequency/usefulness:

1. Accusative
2. Locative
3. Dative
4. Genitive
5. Instrumental
6. Vocative

Nominative is assumed known (dictionary form).

## Exercise Format

Each case has two practice modes:

### Easy Mode (Multiple Choice)

Present a sentence with a blank and 3-4 options. The sentence provides context for _why_ a particular case is needed.

Example: "Vidím **_" (I see _**) → [psa, psovi, psu, psem]

### Hard Mode (Fill in the Blank)

Same sentence format, but the user types the correct form. No options provided.

## Progression

Users work through one case at a time. New words are introduced gradually within the current case focus. SM-2 spaced repetition handles review scheduling.

## Open questions

1. What about verbs?
2. How will the user progression tracking be? We should create something thats not complex,, but efficient enough. This app's purpose is not to teach Cezch fully, but its to get you there with a foundation so you can build on it out there talking to people.
